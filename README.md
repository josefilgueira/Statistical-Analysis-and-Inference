# Statistical Analysis and Inference – Master’s Coursework

This repository contains a statistics assignment developed during my Master’s program, focused on **descriptive statistics, statistical inference, and hypothesis testing applied to real-world data**.

The project demonstrates my ability to **analyze data rigorously, interpret results correctly, and support conclusions using statistical evidence**, which is a core competency for Data Scientist roles.

## 📊 Project Overview

The analysis includes multiple statistical tasks such as:

- Exploratory and **descriptive statistics** (mean, median, variance, standard deviation)
- Evaluation of **data representativeness and variability**
- Construction of **confidence intervals** for population parameters
- **Hypothesis testing** for:
  - Differences between group means
  - Differences in proportions
  - Paired samples (before/after analysis)
- Interpretation of **p-values**, statistical significance, and practical relevance
- Clear communication of results and conclusions

The work combines **statistical theory with applied analysis**, emphasizing correct methodological choices over black-box computations.

## 🧠 Statistical Concepts Applied

- Measures of central tendency and dispersion  
- Coefficient of variation as a representativeness metric  
- Parametric hypothesis tests (independent and paired t-tests)  
- Confidence interval construction (95% and 98%)  
- Assumption awareness and correct test selection  
- Statistical reasoning applied to real datasets (e.g. glucose level measurements)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Microsoft Excel**  
  Used for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, statistical calculations, and result validation.

- **R**  
  Applied for statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and reproducible computation using built-in statistical functions.

- **Statistical reporting**  
  Results are documented in a structured PDF report, prioritizing clarity, rigor, and interpretability.

## 💡 Relevance for Data Science

This project highlights key skills required in Data Science roles:

- Solid **statistical foundations** for data-driven decision making  
- Ability to **translate data into actionable insights**  
- Rigorous handling of **uncertainty and variability**  
- Clear explanation of analytical results for both technical and non-technical audiences  

While many projects focus primarily on machine learning models, this work demonstrates my ability to **understand, justify, and communicate statistical conclusions**, which is essential for building reliable and interpretable data products.
